AutoParts – 3D Auto Parts Platform (MERN)

AutoParts is a modern MERN-stack web platform for automotive spare parts.
It focuses on interactive 3D product previews, vehicle compatibility filtering, and inquiry-based purchasing instead of online payments. The platform is designed to help auto-parts businesses establish a strong digital presence and scale efficiently.

Overview

The goal of AutoParts is to provide customers with a clear understanding of auto parts before purchase by using 3D visualization and detailed compatibility information. Instead of immediate online payments, customers contact the seller or request a quote, making the system suitable for workshops, resellers, and businesses that prefer manual order handling.
